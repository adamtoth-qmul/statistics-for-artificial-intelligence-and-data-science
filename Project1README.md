# **Project I**

## **Aim of Coursework I.**
The coursework first attempts to establish some general travel patterns of the London Underground Stations by considering passenger exits for all stations during service hours. Using these patterns, Northern Line stations are then classified into either 'work', 'residential', or 'other' categories. The project also includes justification for the selected specific cut-off thresholds.

## **Dataset**
The analysis uses the 'hourlyExits.csv' file generated by Tfl and identifies two 'peak times' of regular weekdays.

## **Libraries and Nature of Operations**
* Pandas was used for dataframe creation and operations obtained on them throughout the project. 
* Matplotlib was used for visualisations.
