# **Project I**

This project attempts to introduce the reader with some general travel patterns of the London Underground Stations 
by considering passenger exits for all stations during service hours. The analysis uses the 'hourlyExits.csv' file
generated by Tfl and identifies two 'peak times' of regular weekdays (in the morning, consisting of Hour07, Hour08, Hour09 and in the evening, consisting of Hour16, Hour17, Hour18). This bi-modal exit distribution is first visualised and further analysed, then used as means to classify stations, according to whether they are 'work-related', 'residential' or 'other' areas. The coursework provides some rudimental justification for the cut-off thresholds (mainly based on plotting the distributions and descriptive statistics). The developed ideas and expectations about stations are then tested on a set of Northern Line Stations.

# **Project II**

The following analysis was carried out as part of an investigation on part of the Texas Department of Transportation (TDoT) regarding the conditions of the bridges of Texas state. The aim of this investigation is to check on the state of bridges so that necessary repairs can be carried out. If this is not done, a bridge can fail. The dataset has information about the bridges and the condition given in the most recent inspection.

### Content

 1. **Section 1: Preparing the data**
      1. Creating a dataframe with relevant variables
      1. Deriving variable 'Age' for each bridge
      1. Excluding very old bridges based on two points (their age and how they are 'historically' classified)
      1. Reducing the number of categories of 'Material' and 'Design' (and the reasons behind it)
      1. Deriving a single integer Current Condition variable for each bridge based on selected ordinal categorical variables
      
 2. **Section 2: Exploratory Analysis**
      1. _Relationship between five predictor variables and target variable_
          * Predictor continuous variables and continuous target variable
          * Predictor categorical variables and continuous target variable
      1. _Relationship between predictor variables_
          * Continuous predictor variables
          * Categorical predictor variables and continuous predictor variables
          * Categorical predictor variables and categorical predictor variables
      1. _Summary of the findings and preliminary conclusions_
      
 3. **Section 3: Regression Modelling**
      1. Transforming categorical variables into dummy variables
      1. Checking for collinearity between variables used in regression analysis
      1. Dropping missing values from relevant columns of dataset
      1. Fitting the regression line - R2 coefficient, variables' coefficient results (comparing the coefficients), interpreting categorical coefficient outputs
      1. Prediction and the error distribution
      1. Plotting the regression line



# **Project III**
This paper's analysis is focused on different areas/regions of the United Kingdom with respect to property prices. The analysis will first prepare the datasets the work will be based on, visualise and comment on the most noticable trends and price changes with respect to certain property types. The paper then carries out a Chi-Squared Test in order to see whether changes in the prices of flats have affected all the regions similarly between a specified time interval.
