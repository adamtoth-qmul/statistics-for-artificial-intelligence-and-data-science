**Project I**

This project attempts to introduce the reader with some general travel patterns of the London Underground Stations 
by considering passenger exits for all stations during service hours. The analysis uses the 'hourlyExits.csv' file
generated by Tfl and identifies two 'peak times' of regular weekdays (in the morning, consisting of Hour07, Hour08, Hour09 and in the evening, consisting of Hour16, Hour17, Hour18). This bi-modal exit distribution is first visualised and further analysed, then used as means to classify stations, according to whether they are 'work-related', 'residential' or 'other' areas. The coursework provides some rudimental justification for the cut-off thresholds (mainly based on plotting the distributions and descriptive statistics). The developed ideas and expectations about stations are then tested on a set of Northern Line Stations.

**Project II**

The following analysis was carried out as part of an investigation on part of the Texas Department of Transportation (TDoT) regarding the conditions of the bridges of Texas state. The aim of this investigation is to check on the state of bridges so that necessary repairs can be carried out. If this is not done, a bridge can fail. The dataset has information about the bridges and the condition given in the most recent inspection.

### Content

 1. **Section 1: Preparing the data**
      1. Creating a dataframe with relevant variables
      1. Deriving variable 'Age' for each bridge
      1. Excluding very old bridges based on two points (their age and how they are 'historically' classified)
      1. Reducing the number of categories of 'Material' and 'Design' (and the reasons behind it)
      1. Deriving a single integer Current Condition variable for each bridge based on selected ordinal categorical variables
