# **Project III.**

## **Aim of Coursework III.**
This paper's analysis is focused on different areas/regions of the United Kingdom with respect to property prices.
The analysis will first prepare the datasets the work will be based on, visualise and comment on the most noticable
trends and price changes with respect to certain property types. The paper then carries out a Chi-Squared Test in 
order to see whether changes in the prices of flats have affected all the regions similarly between a specified time
interval.

## **Dataset**
The analysis uses the 'average-property-price.csv', which contains information about the average price of properties
(4 types) over 36 months in different areas of the country. The 'location-codes.csv' dataset is also used, which shows
which region each are belongs to. 

## **Libraries and Nature of Operations**
* Pandas was used for dataframe creation and operations obtained on them throughout the project. 
* Matplotlib was used for visualisations.
